Bank Client-Server System Project

1. Introduction:
The Bank Client-Server System Project is a comprehensive solution designed to facilitate banking operations through client-server communication. This system comprises various components, including the Qt Server Application, Qt Client Application, Node-Red flow, Cassandra Database Code, and JSON file code. Together, these components enable users to perform banking tasks such as account management, transactions, and data retrieval securely.

2. Components:

2.1 Qt Server Application Code:**
The Qt Server Application code provides the backbone for the server-side functionality. It handles incoming client connections, manages user authentication, and facilitates data exchange with the Cassandra database. Key features include:
- Handling TCP connections with clients.
- Processing client requests for login, account management, and transactions.
- Interfacing with the Cassandra database to store and retrieve user data.

2.2 Qt Client Application Code:
The Qt Client Application code serves as the interface for end-users to interact with the banking system. It enables clients to connect to the server, authenticate themselves, and perform various banking operations. Key features include:
- Establishing TCP connections with the server.
- Sending requests for login, account management, and transactions.
- Displaying responses received from the server and providing a user-friendly interface.

2.3 Node-Red Flow:
The Node-Red flow acts as an intermediary between the Qt Client Application and the Cassandra database. It receives data from clients, processes it, and forwards relevant information to the database for storage or retrieval. Key features include:
- Parsing incoming data from clients, such as login credentials and transaction details.
- Routing data to the appropriate components, such as the Cassandra database for storage.
- Responding to client requests and forwarding database query results back to the Qt Client Application.

2.4 Cassandra Database Code:
The Cassandra Database Code defines the schema and queries necessary for storing and retrieving banking data. It provides a robust data storage solution capable of handling concurrent access and large volumes of transactions. Key features include:
- Creating the keyspace and tables required for storing user accounts and transaction history.
- Supporting queries for user authentication, account management, and transaction tracking.
- Ensuring data consistency and durability through Cassandra's distributed architecture.

2.5 JSON File Code:
The JSON File Code contains sample data representing user accounts. It serves as a reference for testing and populating the Cassandra database with realistic user information. Key features include:
- Structuring user data in JSON format, including usernames, passwords, account numbers, balances, and ages.
- Providing a convenient means for initializing the database with pre-existing user accounts for testing purposes.

3. Integration and Interactions:
The Bank Client-Server System Project integrates seamlessly to enable end-to-end banking operations. The Qt Client Application communicates with the Qt Server Application over TCP/IP, while the Node-Red flow facilitates data exchange between the Qt Client Application and the Cassandra database. Key interactions include:
- Client authentication and request processing by the Qt Server Application.
- Data parsing and forwarding by the Node-Red flow to the Cassandra database.
- Database query execution and response transmission back to the Qt Client Application for display to the user.

4. Conclusion:
The Bank Client-Server System Project offers a robust and efficient solution for managing banking operations through client-server communication. By leveraging the capabilities of Qt, Node-Red, Cassandra, and JSON, it provides a flexible and scalable platform for meeting the diverse needs of banking institutions and their customers.
